Sometimes it's impossible to remember a specific ip of a network printer - copier and it's getting even more difficult 
when you have to manipulate many sites.The printers html contains a table of sites. Each site has network printing 
devices  (printers, multifunction machines, copiers) and so you can easily find the desired machine name which is mapped 
with a specific address.
